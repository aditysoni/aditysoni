### :woman_technologist: About Me :

 My journey began during the COVID era, when I had plenty of time to explore what was happening in the tech world – and avoid making yet another sourdough starter. Little did I know what my destiny would be. I started by creating web applications as a MERN developer in college, dabbling with Kafka, and experimenting with in-memory storage like Redis (because sometimes, you just need data faster than instant noodles). I debated whether NoSQL or SQL was better (spoiler: it's like choosing between pizza and momos – both are amazing). Then, I discovered Docker, putting my applications in containers and delivering them directly using something called pipelines (not the kind that need plumbers, thankfully).

Then, I stumbled upon Bitcoin. My goofy mind led me to explore blockchain, and I realized there was nothing quite like it. Like who offers loan without collateral and gives you so much power without giving you all , provided the protocol isn't compromised (talk about living on the edge). Going deep into the protocols , I got a project on real-world tokenization, which became a research project in college.

I'm always eager to engage in discussions about new ideas and emerging technologies, constantly seeking ways to push the boundaries of what's possible – because who needs limits when you have infinite loops?
